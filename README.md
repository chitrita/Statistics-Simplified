# StatzStartz
Repository containing all code and media for an ongoing and ever-growing course in applied and theoretical statistics.

This is an attempt to take the nigh-impenetrable "Stastical Inference" by Casella and Berger and turn it into a highly accessible collection of Powerpoint presentations that illustrate key concepts of probability and statistics as simply as possible.  Each presentation will cover a very small number of key concepts (e.g. the concept of a sample space, or a single probability distribution).  It starts with basic set theory goes in the order of the book.

This repository will also include any R code used in the illustration of examples, etc.

I don't ever anticipate finishing this project, as it is a hobby done in my spare time and I am really lazy, so I am hosting it on github to inspire others (hopefully smarter and more driven than myself) to work to make knowledge as accessible as possible.

Please also feel free to reach out to me with comments about accuracy and conciseness.  I wasn't the most diligent grad student, admittedly.
